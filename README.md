# Flow Field Implementation

## Framework
The framework used in this project is a school provided c++ framework (Elite Framework).
It contains math and SDL libraries. They also provided basic agents, graphs and navigation colliders.

## Purpose
The purpose of the flow field is to emulate seemingly intelligent movement among a large group of agents.
The idea is that instead of calculating a path for every single agent in a virtual world, you calculate one (or more) flow field(s)
from which the agents can read a direction from to know what way to go.
This optimizes performance for path finding with a large group of agents.

## Implementation
Most of the code resides in the FlowField.h & FlowField.cpp files.

I first started by creating new node types for the provided graphs (in EGraphNodeType.h).
  * FlowfieldNode: This holds the cost and direction.
  * IntegrationfieldNode: This holds the integration cost.

I made 2 graphs: the flow field (with cost field) and the integration field.

### Cost field
The first thing to create is the cost field. The lower the cost of a node, the easier the terrain is to traverse.
You can set the cost of a node to be very high to act as impassable terrain. I used a value of 100000 as the cost of impassable terrain.
In this implementation I only have a cost of 0 (easy terrain) or a cost of 100000 (impassable terrain).

### Integration field
The integration field is where most of the work happens. It is calculated using a pathfinding algorithm.
In this implementation I used a Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm. 
Before we start the algorithm we first need a **Goal Node**. When we have a goal node we can start the BFS.

The steps the algorithm takes are:
  * Reset the integration cost of all the nodes to a very high number
  * Create a closed and open list.
  * Add the goal node to the open list.
  * Loop over the openlist while it's not empty.
     * Get the **current node** out of the openlist.
     * Loop over the neighbours of the current node.
        * Check if the neighbour node's cost is not higher or equal to impassable terrain (100000).
            * Check if the neighbour node is not in the closed list.
                * Calculate the intigration cost (current node's integration cost + cost of the connection + neighbour's cost field cost)
                     * If the neighbour's integration cost > calculated intigration cost
                        * Set the neighbour's intigration cost to the calculated intigration cost
                     * Check if the neighbour node is not in the openlist
                        * Add the neighbour node to the openlist
     * Add the currentnode to the closed list.

### Flow/Vector field
Once the Algorithm is done we can start to create the vector field, which is basically the resulting flow field

For each current node we check all it's neighbours and check which of them has the lowest integration cost.
we then set the direction of the current node to be a vector from the current node's center to the center of the lowest cost neighbour and normalize it.

now the flowfield is calculated.

### Agents
With the flowfield calculated I now update the agents. I check in what node they currently are in and give them the linear velocity of the direction of that node.
I multiply that direction with a set speed.

### Extra's
The goal node in this implementation is from the start set to the top left node. 
When they reach the goal node another node without a wall is randomly selected as the next goal node.
You can also set a goal node by left clicking on a node. you can place walls by middle mouse clicking on a node. 
The flowfield will automatically update when placing a new wall or goal node.

I also added checkboxes using IMGUI to show the flow/vector field, the cost field and the integration field.
